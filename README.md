# NFL-Projections
Using python and web-scraped data to project the outlook of NCAA players in the NFL.


#Background
This was the Term Project (TP) that I made for my Intro to Computer Programming class in Spring 2018. If you have questions feel free to tweet at me (@itsfootballtime). I love sports so I'm sure I'll be happy to help!

All the data is publically sourced using the beautiful soup package to webscrape. I included the Web Scrapping set up file. If you want to update the databases you'll have to run that again and compile all the dictionaries. Due to the nature of python (and my inexperience) this took an extremely long time the first time around so be warned (I guess?).

#How To Run
You're going to need all the files that I uploaded. After compiling everything (as long as I didn't change any name you shouldn't have to do anything here) you can run the code in TPAnimationRun.py. This should bring up the animation that will ask you to enter stats for the prospect you are looking at. It will also give you a projected floor and ceiling. 

#Links
I uploaded a video to YouTube going over what the program does and running through a couple of examples (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubmc3RvrOKY)!
There is also an article about the project but the website it is on is currently down so I'll leave a link when it comes back online!
